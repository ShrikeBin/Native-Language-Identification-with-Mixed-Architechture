# Recommended Models To Train:

Model training scripts were optimized to work on RTX 3060ti with 8gb of VRAM

- RoBERTa Full Fine tune (best balance, transformer only)
- CNN on RoBERTa (very cheap, 1% decrease)
- CNN + RoBERTa (good fit combines both worlds) (BEST ONE)
- CNN + RoBERTa Large (Highest Accuracy on the DataSet (81%)) (BUT SUCKS)
