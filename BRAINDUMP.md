- normalization of data helped to produce proper validation
- need to create dataset with balanced classes (more or less)
- balanced classess are REQUIRED for validation and testing

- models seem to overtrain on major clases (Chinese, Korean, Spanish)
- probably due to reduction of unverified data models have problems with Polish and Other Slavic - consistently mapping them in ~ 33% of cases to russian - possible fixes?
- remove Other slavic? and uralic?
