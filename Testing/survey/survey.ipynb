I am using data from Lichess Database, they have a lot of games recorded. Currently I am using Python with some libraries for this project. Main steps are: parsing data, creating features from moves, building a machine learning model, and showing plots for the results. All features are created manually, based on some observations about how chess works. I thought about building a neural network to get more advanced model, but I prefer more interpretation in my model, not just a black box. However, I am thinking about creating an automated feature-builder for more complex features, such as \"accuracy of moving the Queen during the endgame\", where multiple conditions meet.')"

This prevents unified action on critical global challenges. Conflict: It fuels inter-group conflict by reinforcing negative stereotypes and making individuals unwilling to consider alternative perspectives or evidence of an opposing group's positive motives. ​By reducing the automatic, biased filtration of information, people would be more receptive to objective facts and diverse viewpoints, leading to better-informed decisions for the collective good. ​Would you like to discuss the Fundamental Attribution Error next, or ask about its impact on a specific global issue?\")"
